### Introduction
These are a collection of solutions to the "challenges" in the book 
[Doing Math with Python: Use Programming to Explore Algebra, Statistics, Calculus, and More!](https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Math-Python-Programming-Statistics/dp/1593276400) by Amit Saha.

### Solutions to the book's problems...
* [even-odd_generator.py:](even-odd_generator.py) script that takes an input (int), determine's its parity and prints out 'even' or 'odd' based on the result. __(chapter 1, problem 1)__
* [fraction_calculator.py:](fraction_calculator.py) takes two fractions as input and performs a binary operation \(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division\) and prints the result. __(chapter 1, problem 4)__
* [temperature_variation.py:](temperature_variation.py) shows a line plot of the temperature of New York and Las Vegas. __(chapter 2, problem 1)__
* [timestable_generator.py:](timestable_generator.py) takes an integer 'k' and another integer 'n' and generates a multiplication table of 'k' for 'n' multiples. __(chapter 1, problem 2)__
* [unitconvert.py:](unitconvert.py) converts various physics units (distance, weight and temperature) __(chapter 1, problem 3)__
* [visualise_quadradic.py:](visualise_quadradic.py) uses _matplotlib's pyplot_ to generate a cartesian plot of a polynomial function. __(chapter 2, problem 2)__
* [LLN.py:](./LLN.py) demonstrates the law of large numbers by simulating a dice simulation, calculating the expected value of a dice cast, and plotting the simulation mean with the calculated expected value (see [LLN_example.png](./LLN_example.png) for an example output). __(chapter 5, problem 2)__
* [gamblers_ruin.py:](./gamblers_ruin.py) simulation programme that illustrates the gamblers ruin problem with a simple 'coin-flip' game where $1.00 is awarded if 'heads' and $1.50 is lost if 'tails'. (see [gamblers_ruin-example.png](./gamblers_ruin-example.png) for an example output). __(chapter 5, problem 3)__
