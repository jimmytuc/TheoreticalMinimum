## Chapter 1, Problem 68
## Implementation by: Alexander Ahmann, ahmann@gaussian.horse

## PROBLEM: Watch the first introductory VPython video, VPython
## Instructional Videos 1: 3D Objects, at vpython.org/video01.html and
## complete the challenge activity at the end of the video.

## SOLUTION: The challenge described in the video (starting at the
## 3:10 mark) is to recreate the three-dimensional scene (as shown
## in the 3:13 mark). I've defined a new function called 'render_this'
## which takes a position vector, an axis vector, and a name for the
## shape to be rendered, and calls upon the 'sphere' and 'arrow'
## functions to render said objects, which has its parameters stored
## in a multidimensional list.

from visual import *

def render_this(v_pos, v_aaxis, thing_name):
	print("[*] Rendering the",thing_name,"Thing...")
	sphere(pos=v_pos, radius=0.5, color=color.green)
	arrow(pos=v_pos, axis=v_aaxis, color=color.red)

parameters = [
	[vector(0,0,0),vector(0,-1,0),"Middle-Centre"],
	[vector(+2,+1,0),vector(-1,0,0),"Top-Right"],
	[vector(+2,-1,0),vector(+1,+1,0),"Bottom-Right"]
]

for n, k in enumerate(parameters):
	render_this(k[0], k[1], k[2])
